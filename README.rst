**see** is an alternative to the built-in ``dir`` function in Python. It shows
you what you can do with things.

Supports Python 2.6+ and 3.2+. Also works in iPython and PyPy.

Install
-------

To install **see**, run::

    $ pip install --upgrade see


Usage
-----

**see** is designed for the interactive Python interpreter. Import the ``see``
function like so::

    >>> from see import see

Call ``see()`` without arguments to see all objects in the global scope. ::

    >>> foo = 'bar'
    >>> see()
        foo      see()

Call ``see(an_object)`` to see what you can do with ``an_object``. ::

    >>> number = 1
    >>> see(number)
        +             -             *             /             //            %
        **            <<            >>            &             ^             |
        +obj          -obj          ~             <             <=            ==
        !=            >             >=            abs()         bool()
        divmod()      float()       hash()        help()        hex()
        int()         long()        oct()         repr()        str()
        .bit_length()               .conjugate()  .denominator  .imag
        .numerator    .real


Startup
-------

You can use a Python startup file to ensure that ``see`` is available every
time you run Python. The following example uses a startup file named
``.pythonrc.py`` in the user's home directory:

1. Create the Python startup file, if it does not already exist::

       touch ~/.pythonrc.py

2. Open this file in your preferred editor. Add the following line::

       from see import see

3. Set the following environment variable (e.g. in ``~/.bashrc`` for Bash)::

       export PYTHONSTARTUP="$HOME/.pythonrc.py"

Now you can use ``see`` immediately after running ``python``, without having to
manually import it.
